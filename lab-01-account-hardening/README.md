# AWS Account Hardening lab

## objective
Secure AWS Account at a professional security baseline

## Action taken
- Enabled MFA on root account
- Verified no root access keys exist
- Restricted root account usage to account-level tasks only

## Security Rationale
The root account has unrestricted permissions. Enabling MFA and removing or making there are no access keys reduces the risk of account compromise and aligns with least-privilege and AWS security best practices.
